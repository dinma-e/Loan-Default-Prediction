### **Loan Default Prediction**

Financial institutions face a constant challenge: balancing the need to provide loans with the risk of borrowers defaulting. Every default not only leads to financial loss but also affects trust and long-term sustainability. With the rise of digital lending platforms, the ability to anticipate potential defaults has become more important than ever.

As part of my data science journey, I worked on this project as a capstone to apply machine learning techniques to the problem of loan default prediction. The goal was not just to see how well models could classify borrowers, but also to uncover meaningful insights from the data. Rather than focusing only on accuracy, I aimed to understand the dataset, build predictive models, evaluate their performance, and reflect on the lessons learned.

This project highlights both the opportunities and challenges of applying machine learning in financial contexts, especially when working with limited data, and serves as a step forward in strengthening my skills as a data scientist.

All datasets, the full notebook and the power bi file are contained in this repository.
